# Air  Brakes for KillJoy 2021

This is the code for the Air Brakes used on the subscale rocket KillJoy (2021). The code is written taking into consideration 1 d.o.f and 3 states of deployment for the Air Brakes with 0%, 50% and 100% states. The code is written for an Arduino MKR ZERO which uses a pitot for velocity, BMP388 for altitude determination and BNO055 for the acceleration.
