# Ignition System
This is the code for the wireless ignition system.
The code is written for an Arduino Uno.
The RF module used is an nRF24L01.
<p>The ignition system uses 2 toggle switches for Arm and Launch.
The signal for launch is sent only when the switches are switched in a certain order i.e. Safety --> Arm --> Launch</p>
<p>Note: Safety is used to power on the system.</p>
